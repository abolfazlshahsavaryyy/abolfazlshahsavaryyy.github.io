Hi, I’m **Abolfazl Shahsavari** 👋  

I’m a software developer with **1 year of experience** in **web development** and **machine learning**.  
I enjoy building scalable applications and integrating AI into real-world systems.  

Some of my main skills and interests include:
- Developing **web applications** with Django, FastAPI, and .NET  
- Deploying and integrating **machine learning models** into production systems
