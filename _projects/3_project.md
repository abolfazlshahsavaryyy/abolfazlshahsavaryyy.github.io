This project is a **Watch Store Web Application** built with the **MVC architecture in ASP.NET**.  
It uses **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap** for the front-end, and **SQL Server** as the database.

The goal of this project was to create a responsive and user-friendly platform where users can browse, search, and purchase watches.  
It demonstrates strong integration between front-end design and back-end data handling.
