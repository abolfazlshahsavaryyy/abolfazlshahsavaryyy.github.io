The **Microservice Shopping Web API** is a distributed system built with **ASP.NET Core**, following clean architecture principles and modern service communication patterns.  

It leverages **Carter** for lightweight routing, **MediatR** for CQRS and request/response handling, and is fully containerized with **Docker & Docker Compose** for seamless deployment.

## üìå Core Features

### üõí Shopping API
- RESTful **Shopping Service** for managing products, carts, and orders.  
- Built using **ASP.NET Core** + **Carter**.  

### ‚ö° CQRS with MediatR
- Clear separation of **commands** and **queries**.  
- Extensible request/response pipeline with MediatR behaviors.  

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Layer
- **SQL Server** in Docker for structured relational data.  
- **PostgreSQL + Marten** for document-style persistence (NoSQL-like).  

### üê≥ Dockerized Microservices
- Fully configured with **Docker Compose**.  
- Runs SQL Server, Postgres, and API services seamlessly in isolated containers.
