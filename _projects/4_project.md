This project is a **Restaurant Management System** developed using **WPF in ASP.NET**.  
It leverages **SQL Server** as the database and integrates **Dapper ORM** for efficient data access.  
The system makes use of both **SQL queries** and **XML mapping with Dapper** to manage and retrieve data.  

The front-end is built in **WPF**, offering an intuitive interface for restaurant staff to handle tasks such as **order management, table tracking, and menu updates**.  

This project was created in collaboration with [Sepehr Narimani](https://github.com/sepehrnarimani).
