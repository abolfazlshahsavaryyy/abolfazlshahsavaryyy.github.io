This project implements a **Decision Tree classifier from scratch** using only **NumPy** and **Pandas**.  
The model is trained on web request data to detect **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks**.  

The focus of this project is understanding how decision trees work internally, including **splitting criteria, entropy, and information gain**, without relying on libraries like `scikit-learn`.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Features
- Decision Tree implemented **from scratch** (no scikit-learn)  
- Uses only **NumPy and Pandas**  
- **Trained on DDoS attack detection** in web requests  
- Implements **entropy, information gain, and recursive splitting**  
- Easy to extend for other classification tasks
