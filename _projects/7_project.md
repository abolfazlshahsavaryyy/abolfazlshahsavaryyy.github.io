This project applies a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to solve systems of equations with **2, 3, or 4 unknown variables**.  
The GA simulates the process of **evolution and natural selection** to optimize solutions iteratively, making it possible to approximate the roots of complex nonlinear systems without analytical methods.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Features
- Implements a **Genetic Algorithm from scratch**  
- Solves **equation systems with 2, 3, and 4 unknowns**  
- Encodes candidate solutions as **chromosomes**  
- Uses **selection, crossover, and mutation** operators  
- Fitness function evaluates error between predicted and expected values  
- Extensible for solving other optimization problems
