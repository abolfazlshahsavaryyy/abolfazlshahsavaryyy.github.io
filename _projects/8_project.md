This project implements a system to **assign tasks to multiple systems** using **graph theory** and **network flow algorithms**.  
The goal is to optimize task allocation efficiently across available systems, minimizing conflicts and maximizing throughput.  

This project was developed in collaboration with:  
- GitHub: [Amin Shiravani](https://github.com/AminShiravani)  
- GitHub: [Mahdi Dehghani](https://github.com/PMahdiDehghaniP)

### ðŸ”¹ Key Features
- Task assignment modeled as a **graph problem**  
- Utilizes **network flow algorithms** for optimal allocation  
- Handles multiple tasks and systems simultaneously  
- Extensible for larger networks and distributed systems  
- Visualizations of task allocation and flow in the network
